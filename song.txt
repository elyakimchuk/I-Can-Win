My loneliness is killin me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe. (still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time!

Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you.
Boy you've got me blinded.
Oh pretty baby, there's nothin that I wouldn't do.
That's not the way I planned it.
